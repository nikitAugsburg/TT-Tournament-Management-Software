# Tournament Management UI Rule

## Purpose
This rule documents the Tournament Management UI module, including tournament list, details, bracket visualization, and editor, referencing the [UI Model Diagram](mdc:https:/app.eraser.io/workspace/
j1oDjupLKMatm62PhLD2?origin=share&elements=zkJ1X3JQWqCxT_1tSY_rUg) and [project-description.mdc](mdc:project-description.mdc).

## Key Components
- Tournament List: View, create, edit, delete tournaments
- Tournament Details: Overview, participants, settings
- Bracket Visualization: Single/Double Elimination, Round Robin, Swiss, Groups, Groups+PlayOff
- Bracket Editor: Manual adjustments

## Structure
Refer to the following diagram for the tournament management architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Tournament List"]
    B["Tournament Details"]
    C["Bracket Visualization"]
    D["Bracket Editor"]
    E["State Management"]
    F["Player Management"]
    G["Match Management"]
    H["SQLite Persistence"]

    A -- "Select/View" --> B
    B -- "Show/Update" --> C
    C -- "Edit" --> D
    D -- "Update" --> C
    B -- "Manage Players" --> F
    C -- "Update Matches" --> G
    A -- "CRUD" --> E
    B -- "CRUD" --> E
    C -- "CRUD" --> E
    D -- "CRUD" --> E
    E -- "Persist" --> H
    H -- "Hydrate" --> E
```

## Best Practices
- Keep tournament logic modular and format-agnostic.
- Validate all bracket and participant changes.
- Document all UI flows and components in English.
 Reference [project-description.mdc](mdc:project-description.mdc) for business logic and requirements.

## Usage
Use this rule for all code generation, navigation, and documentation tasks related to Tournament Management UI.

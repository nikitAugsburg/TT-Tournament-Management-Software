# Player Management UI Rule

## Purpose
This rule documents the Player Management UI module, including player list, details, and add/edit functionality, with reference to tournaments.

## Key Components
- Player List: View, add, edit, delete players (with search/filter, referenced to any tournament)
- Player Details: Info (name, club, rating), edit functionality
- Add/Edit Player: Form for adding or editing players, with validation

## Structure
Refer to the following diagram for the player management architecture:

    B["Player Details"]
    C["Add/Edit Player"]
    D["State Management"]
    E["Tournament Management"]
    F["Match Management"]
    G["SQLite Persistence"]

    A -- "Select/View" --> B
    A -- "Add/Edit/Delete" --> C
    B -- "Edit" --> C
    C -- "Save" --> A
    A -- "CRUD" --> D
    B -- "CRUD" --> D
    C -- "CRUD" --> D
    D -- "Persist" --> G
    G -- "Hydrate" --> D
    A -- "Reference" --> E
    A -- "Stats" --> F
```

## Best Practices
- Keep player logic modular and reusable.
- Validate all player data and input (unique name, required fields).
- Document all UI flows and components in English.

## Usage
Use this rule for all code generation, navigation, and documentation tasks related to Player Management UI.

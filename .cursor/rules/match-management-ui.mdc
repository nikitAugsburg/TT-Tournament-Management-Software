# Match Management UI Rule

## Purpose
This rule documents the Match Management UI module, including match list, details, and integration with tournaments and players.

## Key Components
- Match List: View, edit, filter matches in a tournament
- Match Details: Info (players, round, table, status, scores), edit functionality

## Structure
Refer to the following diagram for the match management architecture:

```mermaid

    A["Match List"]
    B["Match Details"]
    C["State Management"]
    D["Tournament Management"]
    E["Player Management"]
    F["Bracket Visualization"]
    G["SQLite Persistence"]

    A -- "Select/View" --> B
    A -- "CRUD" --> C
    B -- "Edit/Update" --> C
    C -- "Persist" --> G
    G -- "Hydrate" --> C
    A -- "Reference" --> D
    B -- "Players" --> E
    B -- "Update Bracket" --> F
    B -- "Update Player Stats" --> E
```

## Best Practices
- Keep match logic modular and reusable.
- Validate all match data and input.
- Document all UI flows and components in English.

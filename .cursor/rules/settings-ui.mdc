# Settings UI Rule

## Purpose
This rule documents the Settings & Configuration UI module, including application settings, tournament templates, export, and backup/restore.

## Key Components
- Application Settings: General preferences (theme, language, notifications)
- Tournament Templates: Save/load, create, edit, delete templates
- Export Options: Export tournament, match, and player data (PDF, CSV, etc.)
- Backup & Restore: Backup and restore all app data

## Structure
Refer to the following diagram for the settings and configuration architecture:

    A["Application Settings"]
    B["Tournament Templates"]
    C["Export Options"]
    D["Backup & Restore"]
    E["State Management"]
    F["SQLite Persistence"]
    G["Tournament Management"]
    H["Player Management"]
    I["Match Management"]

    A -- "CRUD" --> E
    B -- "CRUD" --> E
    C -- "Export" --> G
    C -- "Export" --> H
    C -- "Export" --> I
    D -- "Backup/Restore" --> F
    E -- "Persist" --> F
    F -- "Hydrate" --> E
```

## Best Practices
- Keep settings logic modular and reusable.
- Validate all user input and backup files.
- Document all UI flows and components in English.

## Usage
Use this rule for all code generation, navigation, and documentation tasks related to Settings & Configuration UI.

# Core Application Shell Rule

## Purpose
This rule documents the structure and responsibilities of the Core Application Shell, including window management, IPC, and navigation.

## Key Tasks
- Implement main application container and window management in Tauri (Rust)
- Set up secure IPC channels between backend and frontend
- Scaffold navigation bar, side panel, and main content area in React
- Set up routing and placeholder pages for all major modules

## Structure
Refer to the following diagram for the core shell architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Tauri Main Process (Rust)"]
    B["React Renderer (Frontend)"]
    C["IPC Channel"]
    D["Main Window"]
    E["Navigation Bar"]
    F["Side Panel"]
    G["Main Content Area"]
    H["Placeholder Pages"]

    A -- "Launches" --> D
    D -- "Renders" --> B
    B -- "Sends/Receives" --> C
    C -- "Handles" --> A
    B --> E
    B --> F
    B --> G
    G --> H
    H --> H1["Tournament Management"]
    H --> H2["Player Management"]
    H --> H3["Match Management"]
    H --> H4["Settings"]
```

## Best Practices
- Use Tauri's security features for IPC.
- Keep navigation and window logic modular and reusable.
- Document all shell components and flows in English.

## Usage
Use this rule as a reference for all code generation, navigation, and documentation tasks related to the application shell.
